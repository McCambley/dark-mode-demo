# Dark Mode with CSS Variables
Create a dark mode toggle using CSS Variables and Javascript

## Overview
This project is a small demonstration on how to refactor a repository from using many individual color values accross a style sheet to using only a few attached to a consolidated class of CSS variables. Once set, not only is the code base more readable, but we can now create a custom checkbox in order to toggle a "Dark Mode" theme and a "Light Mode" theme very easily. This project two versions: a before refactoring and an after refactoring and toggle implimentation. Header [here](https://www.example.com) to view the project walkthrough.

Enjoy!
